# What is an Intranet?

An intranet is like a private internet that is only accessible to the people in a particular organization. Imagine it as a secure online space where employees can share information, communicate, and collaborate with each other. 

It usually contains important company information, resources, and tools that help employees do their jobs more effectively. Unlike the internet, which anyone can access, an intranet is restricted to a specific group of users, making it a safe environment for sharing sensitive information.
